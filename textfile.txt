What does a thing needs to happen for travel to be free.
Travel and logging?
Working or maybe voluntary work that pays for travel?


Let's say work. what type of work would it be? There is nanny work, working on cruises?

Like I just saw a website about Global work travel, so maybe have that. A website posting seasonal work that accept foreign workers, that offers logging.
